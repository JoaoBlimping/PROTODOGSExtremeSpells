Here are some ideas that I have


POWERUP SYSTEM:
	ok so what I am thinking for powerups in the game is that you have this
	big box on the side of the screen and all the other characters's heads
	are bouncing around in it, and when you get a powerup, it goes into the
	box and whichever character it hits gets to have the powerup, and then
	when a character gets like 50 of them they activate some kind of special
	ability

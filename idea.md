# League of Scumbags A: PROTODOGS Extreme Spells

## Little Details about the game

The moral of the story is that you need to figure out how to go hyper power at will.

## Things yet to be added

- proper inventory that lets you open it up and use items, to open it in adventure mode you will have to press right click / shift, and then select the item from a list. Normal items like keys and situational shit will not go into your inventory
- record some like minute long radio segments where I just talk about complete shit.

## Main Story

You wake up in the middle of the night in this random room and PHM and Aini are standing there, and the phm is like
```
Oi! it's time to get out of this hell hole, the cops have stopped
patrolling the streets for some reason.
I can't wait to get out of this fucking dump.
Thanks for letting us stay here though, Travongle
```
Then tavongle says

```
Yeah all good man, uh so do you know where we're going?
```

Aini says ```You're coming with us?```, and phm is like

```
Well we can't really leave Travongle here now he's kept us hidden from the cops for three days, they'll find out eventually.
No clue where we should go though, I guess we can just figure it out.
```

Travongle then says:

```
Don't worry cunts, I know a spot in the bush.
I used to grow weed out there before I got too paranoid for that shit.
Anyway, there's an alain village, so I reckon they'll let us stay
for a while til we can all figure something out.
```

```
Don't have a car though, lol
Most of the time if somebody parks their car around here someone lights
it on fire anyway.
```

Then Aini Says:

```
Well stealing a car does sound pretty fun,
we'll just have to actually find one.
```

**Ok, you are now free to click around. basically you just have to go to the back yard, then go through a hole in the fence to get to the special ed school, then steal their bus.**

Before you leave, travongle says

```
Alright, to get out to the bush we just want to take the road west, once we get out to the bush I can give you closer directions.
```

**Driving bit where you only have the choice of driving to the bush**

Ok so now you have gotten to the encampment of the alains, and there are a couple hanging around but basically they all just say that you've gotta go speak to the cheif in the main hut.

Once you go in there he starts talking

```
you've put us all in a lot of danger coming here like this.
We know something is happening here in the bush. At the very least you could tell us what it is.
```

phm says ```something's happening?```
```I guess we noticed all the cops are gone, is it related to that?```

The chief says:

```
Oh, I guess so, we know nothing about that though.
Well you know since you're putting out on a limb hard
coming out here, I think you can check it out for us.
```

```
I sense it coming from the south. There's a fire trail you
can follow down to about the right spot.
```

```see you```

Ok then you can leave and now when you talk to the village people they say other stuff and maybe one of them gives you a shitty book where you can mark down all of the animals you've run over.

ok so anyway you get to the alain village in the bush and they say you should go see the cheif but you can talk to all the people there also (they just talk a bit of trash and imply there is heavy shit going on) so you go see the leader of the alains and he says that there is serious stuff going on outside the village according to his antennas and you should go check it out now, and he also sends an alain named Katarom with you.

When you get out of the hut bradongle is there and he's like ayyyy lmao I can finally smoke weed again now I'm back, lets go smonk before you go.
if you say yes then you waste some time and by the time you get to the spot, there are cops analysing it and one of them escapes before you battle which causes ending B at the end.
if you say no then you get there and then the cops show up and you defeat them all and they can't take a sample.
waaaaaaaaait -------- the cops are in a mechsuit thingy, but it's like a prototype or some shit
and if you win it just kinda returns to base and they say that soon the suit will be too strong to fight and they are going to raze this gay village

ok so you go back and you tell this to the alains and they are naturally not too pleased, then they mention that there are these extreme spells that you can collect, and if you do,
you will be able to defeat the mecha, but then they say go sleep on it and tell them in the morning.
during the night you can trigger a cutscene with Aini outside where you talk about why you do this, and she seems unsure, but the place in this world for people
like us is shrinking if it isn't already gone, so the only choice is to fight, or to die slowly.

ok so then you can either choose to fight which continues the game, or choose to not help which triggers ending C instantly.

ok so in the morning the village has received an eviction notice which says that they are going to be kicked out in precisely 4 days, so now you must plan your itinerary:
on monday you will go to kempsey to recover the Harp Spell of Alan Parker
on tuesday you will go to Bellingen to recover Wind Spell of Tango
on wednesday you will go to Agara to recover the Keyboard Spell of Al Kebab
Then on thursday you will gut the robot facility


what happens in kempsey:
• go to the pool and do a swimming minigame
• go to antiques shop to ask about the spell, but it was bought by a fat bitch
• then you have to go to her apartment and it's underground for some reason, and you have to do a bunch of adventure game shit to break in.

what happens in bellingen:
• go to the pub and play the pokies
• cure cancer
• ask about the thing at the antiques shop but it was bought by a hippie

what happens in agara:

each town will have some fun activities beside their battles and shit:
in kempsey your hotel has a pool and you can do a cool swimming minigame where there are a lot of women in bikinis and you have to piss on them sneakily
in bellingen you can do a cool curing cancer minigame
in agara you have to hide in your room so I'll make sure you can enjoy plenty of dialogue with the other characters which there will 5 of now. Also you can watch some funny stuff on the tv.

A: PROTO DOGS extreme spell
This one proceeds from the original.

the moral of the game is that you need to learn to turn into a
dog.

storyline:
After the pyramid you would expect a lot of cops to be around, but oddly enough, there are none. So what is going on you ask?
apparantly they are busy on something more important.
in a back alley you meet this dirty hippie who invites you to his house and you hang out and he says about how there are some alains out in the bush who know what's up, but by this point there are a couple of cops around, so you have to engage in a master plan.
Just behind this dude's house a ways there is a bus depot, and you must break into the bus depot and quickly steal one of the buses without anybody catching you. (if the alarm gets raised then maybe it just means there'll be more cops in the next section.

ok you now enter driving mode and you are driving around in the scumbag mobile. I think what this will consist of is driving around at ridiculous speed avoiding police cars and running destroying various things like rubbish bins and stuff

ok so anyway you get to the alain village in the bush and they say you should go see the cheif but you can talk to all the people there also (they just talk a bit of trash and imply there is heavy shit going on) so you go see the leader of the alains and he says that there is serious stuff going on outside the village according to his antennas and you should go check it out now, and he also sends an alain named Katarom with you.

When you get out of the hut bradongle is there and he's like ayyyy lmao I can finally smoke weed again now I'm back, lets go smonk before you go.
if you say yes then you waste some time and by the time you get to the spot, there are cops analysing it and one of them escapes before you battle which causes ending B at the end.
if you say no then you get there and then the cops show up and you defeat them all and they can't take a sample.
waaaaaaaaait -------- the cops are in a mechsuit thingy, but it's like a prototype or some shit
and if you win it just kinda returns to base and they say that soon the suit will be too strong to fight and they are going to raze this gay village

ok so you go back and you tell this to the alains and they are naturally not too pleased, then they mention that there are these extreme spells that you can collect, and if you do,
you will be able to defeat the mecha, but then they say go sleep on it and tell them in the morning.
during the night you can trigger a cutscene with Aini outside where you talk about why you do this, and she seems unsure, but the place in this world for people
like us is shrinking if it isn't already gone, so the only choice is to fight, or to die slowly.

ok so then you can either choose to fight which continues the game, or choose to not help which triggers ending C instantly.

ok so in the morning the village has received an eviction notice which says that they are going to be kicked out in precisely 4 days, so now you must plan your itinerary:
on monday you will go to kempsey to recover the Harp Spell of Alan Parker
on tuesday you will go to Bellingen to recover Wind Spell of Tango
on wednesday you will go to Agara to recover the Keyboard Spell of Al Kebab
Then on thursday you will gut the robot facility


what happens in kempsey:
• go to the pool and do a swimming minigame
• go to antiques shop to ask about the spell, but it was bought by a fat bitch
• then you have to go to her apartment and it's underground for some reason, and you have to do a bunch of adventure game shit to break in.

what happens in bellingen:
• go to the pub and play the pokies
• cure cancer
• ask about the thing at the antiques shop but it was bought by a hippie

what happens in agara:


each town will have some fun activities beside their battles and shit:
in kempsey your hotel has a pool and you can do a cool swimming minigame where there are a lot of women in bikinis and you have to piss on them sneakily
in bellingen you can do a cool curing cancer minigame
in agara you have to hide in your room so I'll make sure you can enjoy plenty of dialogue with the other characters which there will 5 of now. Also you can watch some funny stuff on the tv.



never mention the cicada at all, just don't go there
